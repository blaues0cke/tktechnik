Code written in BASIC I wrote for my examination in junior high school. The goal was to light up 8 differend leds via the lpt port. I was bored so I wrote this script. It can light up the 8 leds in a lot different ways and you can also enter commands like "123,456" to light led 1, 2 and 3 first and then 456. Also, this script is able to parse morse code to light the leds. You can also enter text that will be converted into morse code.
